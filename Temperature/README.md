# Temperature assignment

Create 3 concrete classes: Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit (be careful about spelling)

Each should have a constructor that takes a single double that represents the temp in the units of the class.

Each class should store the temperature.  

They should also have a getK(), getC(), and getF() method (these return doubles).

Create an interface that includes these methods along with brief JavaDoc style comments.


Each should have a toString method that prints the temperature in the units that correspond to
the concrete class of that object.
e.g. Kelvin k = new Kelvin(500);
k.toString() will return "500°K"

0°K = -273.15°C

*Need to add JavaDoc style comments*
